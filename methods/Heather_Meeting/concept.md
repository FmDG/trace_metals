# Things to do for tomorrow

- [x] Plot up 1208/1209/607 and maybe also 1014/1018 and 849. See where the trends are. Plot this big.
- [x] Plot up Mg/Li, and have a bunch of citations to hand to talk about Mg/Li and why it might work and why it probably
  doesn’t.
- [ ] Look at cluster model, and see if you can plot the cluster model for the three time periods identified and put it
  on a map - make a nice version of the 3D plot (maybe a gif?).
- [x] Show how changing the equations for the Thirumalai model changes things (or doesn’t) and try and find a better
  d18O-salinity relation.
